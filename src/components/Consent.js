                    <p>
                        Counselling is a process where your thoughts are facilitated alongside with your counsellor. As a counsellor, I can only provide you
                        guidance and new perspective to working towards your presented issues. Counselling is not an advice giving. We will work together
                        at a targeted goal that you have set for yourself at your own pace, however, please be noted that we will only have 6 counselling
                        sessions in total, and one session will alst about 50 minutes. At the end of our counselling contract, we shall review your progress
                        together.

                    <p>
                        Counselling  can  provide  a  number  of  benefits  to  you,  including  improving  interpersonal  relationships  and  resolution  of  specific 
                        concerns that lead you to seek therapy. Working towards those benefit, however, it requires effort on your part. Counselling requires 
                        your active involvement, honesty, and openness in order to change your thought, feelings and behavior.  
                        The nature of counselling is to work through issues in a vulnerable moment. Counselling may lead to unanticipated feelings and, 
                        chance that might have an unexpected impact on you. At times, I may challenge some of your assumption or perception or propose 
                        different  way  of  looking  at,  thinking  about,  or  handling  situation.  Uncomfortableness  and  anxious  moment  may  occur  due  to  the 
                        explorative nature of counselling.

                    <p>
                        All information disclosed within the sessions and the written records pertaining to those sessions are kept confidential and may not 
                        be revealed to anyone without your written permission except where disclosure is required by the law. Your full information (case

                    <p>
                        In order to keep the counselling services at the highest professional standards, I am required to note each of our counselling session 
                        for  supervision  and  case  conference.  However,  should  the  content  of  your  case  be  discussed,  easily  identifiable  information  and 
                        details  shall  be  blurred  out  and  you  shall  be  assigned  a  code  name  to  ensure  confidentiality  remains  prominent  throughout  the 
                        discussion. The counselling practitioners are always abide by the ethical framework of good practice at all times.

                    <p>
                        In the event of that we shall run into each other in public, I shall act on a stranger basis to ensure confidentiality and professionalism. 
                        I will assess carefully before entering into a dual relationship with clients (in cases of activity clubs and events) and the  clients are 
                        entitled to decline without any reason. Although dual relationship can enhance trust and therapeutic alliance, it is your responsibility 
                        to advise me should the dual relationship becomes uncomfortable to you in anyway. I will always listen carefully and respond to your 
                        feedback and will discontinue the dual relationship if you find it interfering with the effectiveness of the therapy or your welfare and, 
                        of course, you can do the same at any time.

                        You are recommended to arrive 5 minutes early. If you are late, we will continue the session with the remaining allocated time. If you 
                        are 30 minutes late to the session, it will result in an automatic cancellation of the session. Therefore, should you have issue with 
                        being  late,  or  in  cases  of  emergencies,  please  notify  me  via  email  alongside  with  your  new  3  date  and  time  of  your  preferred
